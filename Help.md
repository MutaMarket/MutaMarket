You can do this by clicking the User icon in the navigation bar or by visiting
the [login page](https://mutamarket.com/login).

## Understanding Abyssal Modules

### What modules should I roll?

First and foremost, rolling abyssal modules is a gamble, and in most cases, it is not a profitable activity. Most of the
time, you are better off buying the specific module you need directly from the market. However, if you still decide to
roll a module, keep these points in mind:

- **Gravid/Decayed Meta Modules**: These rolled modules are typically considered "self-use" only. They are not worth
  selling on the market because finding a buyer for them is extremely challenging. Keep this in mind when rolling such
  modules, as their value will generally be negligible outside personal use.
- **Base Module Limitations**: Some base modules are simply not worth rolling due to the availability of cheaper and
  better alternatives. For example, even a perfectly rolled T2 warp disruptor will always be less valuable than a 30km
  faction warp disruptor. This highlights the importance of carefully evaluating whether the base module you're rolling
  has the potential to compete with readily available alternatives.
- **Officer Module Risks**: Rolling officer modules is an exceptionally risky endeavor. These modules can lose a
  significant amount of value if their roll ends up within a range that is achievable using much cheaper faction
  modules. The potential for a high-value outcome exists, but so does the risk of a substantial loss.

### What mutaplasmids should I use?

As a general guideline, use Decayed and Gravid mutaplasmids for meta modules and reserve Unstable mutaplasmids for
higher-value modules. This strategy helps balance the cost of mutaplasmids against the potential value of the rolled
module. However, there are important exceptions to consider:

- **Specific stat goals**: In some cases, the stats you're aiming for can only be achieved with a specific combination
  of a base module and a particular mutaplasmid. Research carefully to ensure you're using the appropriate combination
  to meet your desired outcome.
- **Unstable mutaplasmid costs**: Some unstable mutaplasmids are prohibitively expensive, often exceeding the value of
  the modules they're applied to. Examples include mutaplasmids for Damage Controls or Large Cap Batteries, where the
  high cost may outweigh the potential benefit unless you’re targeting a very specific and high-value result.

### How do I appraise my modules?

The value of an abyssal module depends on several factors beyond just its stats. Here’s what to consider:

- **Base Module**: The base module contributes inherited stats that can significantly affect value. For example, X-Type
  MWDs are particularly valuable because they lack the capacitor penalty present in other MWDs, making them more
  desirable.
- **Supply of Mutaplasmids**: If specific mutaplasmids are in short supply, even a mediocre roll may eventually sell.
  The availability of mutaplasmids can influence demand and pricing for rolled modules.
- **Current market conditions**: Market saturation plays a big role in pricing. If there are many similar modules on the
  market, prices will drop, especially for modules with lower demand. Keep an eye on market trends to set realistic
  expectations.

#### Tools for appraising modules

- **MutaMarket Appraisal Tool**: Use the module appraisal tool on the site to get an estimate of your module's value.
  This tool leverages historical data to provide a rough valuation. While not exact, it gives a reliable starting point.
- **Market Comparisons**: For the most accurate appraisal, compare your module to similar listings on the market.
  Right-click on any module on the site and select "Search for Similar/Cheapest" to find comparable items. Focus on
  stats that are most important to buyers, such as range, damage, or activation cost, depending on the module type.

## Buying Abyssal Modules

### How to search and filter modules

To browse available abyssal modules, visit the Modules page. This page lists all modules currently for sale, including
those available via in-game contracts or listed directly on the site. You can refine your search using various filters,
such as:

- Type (e.g., MWDs, warp disruptors, damage controls)
- Meta group (e.g., T2, faction, or officer)
- Attributes (e.g., range, damage, activation cost)
- Price
- Estimated value

### Understanding module listings and details

Each module listing provides key information at a glance, including:

- Base module
- Mutaplasmids used
- Attributes rolled
- Price
- Estimated value

For a deeper evaluation, click on any module's listing to view its Detail Page. The detail page includes:

- A complete breakdown of the module's attributes.
- **Contract History**: A timeline showing previous contracts for similar modules, including their prices and dates,
  providing valuable insights into pricing trends.
- **Type Comparisons**: A comparison chart that highlights how the module's attributes stack up against other similar
  types, such as T2, faction, or officer modules.

## Selling Abyssal Modules

### How to list a module for sale

To list a module for sale, you need to provide the module's attributes and the mutaplasmids used to roll it. You also
need to set an asking price for the module. The listing tool will then create a listing for your module, which will be
visible to other users on MutaMarket.

### Tips for effective pricing

To attract buyers, you should set a competitive price for your module. You can use the appraisal tool to get an estimate
of how much your module is worth before listing it for sale. You can also check the prices of similar modules on
MutaMarket to get an idea of what other sellers are asking.

### Managing your listings

You can view and manage your listings in the My Modules section of your account. From here, you can edit your listings,
mark them as sold, or remove them from the marketplace. You can also view the status of your listings and see how many
views and offers they have received.

## Module Appraisal Tool

### How to appraise a module

Visit the [Appraisal Page](https://mutamarket.com/modules/add) and choose one of the following methods to appraise a
module:

- **Appraise by Item Link**: Paste the item link of the module you want to appraise and click "Appraise Module."
- **Appraise by Item ID & Type**: Enter the item ID and type of the module you want to appraise and click "Appraise
  Module."
- **Appraise via EveMail**: Send an EVE mail to the character "MutaMate" with the item. The appraisal tool will respond
  with the estimated value.
- **Appraise via ESI**: Import your assets from EVE Online to MutaMarket and appraise modules directly from your
  inventory.

### Understanding the appraisal tool

The appraisal tool uses historical data to estimate the value of a module based on its attributes. Since the tool is
trained on past sales data, it may not always reflect the current market conditions or lack data for very rare modules.
For the most accurate appraisal, compare your module to similar listings on the market.

### Appraisal tool limitations

Since the appraisal tool is trained on historical data, it may not always reflect the current market conditions.
Especially
for high-value modules, it's recommended to compare your module to similar listings on the market to get a more accurate
appraisal. The appraisal tool is best used as a starting point for pricing your module, rather than a definitive value.

## Asset management

### How to import your assets

You can import your assets from EVE Online by using the asset import tool. The tool will scan your in-game assets and
import them into your MutaMarket account. You can then use the assets to appraise modules, list modules for sale, and
manage your listings.

### How to locate a module in-game

To locate a module in-game, you need to have the module's item ID. You can find the item ID by clicking on the module in
your MutaMarket account. The item ID will be displayed in the module's details page. You can then use the item ID to
search for the module in your in-game assets.

### How to update your assets

You can update your assets by using the asset import tool again. The tool will scan your in-game assets and import any
new items that you have acquired since your last import. You can then use the new assets to appraise modules, list
modules for sale, and manage your listings.

### Troubleshooting asset import

If you are having trouble importing your assets, try logging out of your MutaMarket account and logging back in. This
will refresh your connection to EVE Online and may resolve any issues with the asset import tool. If you continue to
experience problems, feel free to contact us on Discord for assistance.
